        <h1 class="fancy"> Guide to exploring the bowels of UMass</h1>
        <p>Feeling bored? Tired of rotting in your dorm all day? Looking for another way to avoid your assignments? Might I suggest taking a deep dive into the strange and peculiar underbelly of UMass?<p>
        <p>Secret tunnels, bulletin boards with yellowing flyers from 2002, places that have fallen into disuse over the decades– what’s the appeal? Clearly there must be some draw to these desolate spaces as there are dozens of social media pages dedicated to them: including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/umassaliminalspace/"> an Instagram page for liminal spaces around UMass specifically</a>. Perhaps part of it is the feeling of discovery; coming across places that have seemingly gone unused for years can feel as if you’re an explorer who’s just stumbled upon some vast, untouched territory.</p>
        <p>But for the most part, I seek them out for comfort. On a campus with over 30,000 students, there seems to be no escape from the constant onslaught of human interactions. But walking alone down dark corridors hidden from the rest of campus, an indescribable feeling overcomes you. The term "liminal" describes things that exist in a threshold between states. The archetypal liminal space is often a hallway, but it can be any other space typically occupied by people but is now seemingly devoid of any human life. Though arguably eerie in nature, liminal spaces are a place of comfort. With no one around to perceive you, you are free to just exist as you are. There is no past, no future, just you in this moment.</p>
        <p>If this speaks to you, I implore you to read more and learn how to seek out liminal spaces near you.</p>

        <h2>Find spots:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put on shoes.</li>
            <li>Start walking around the campus.</li>
            <li>Be on the lookout for older-looking buildings, as these likely will have areas that experience less traffic.</li>
            <li>Once inside a building, explore as you please– consider areas such as the basement or hallways down the back of the building.</li>
            <li>Enjoy exploring, but be mindful of respecting the space and staying out of areas that you do not have access to.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Find people:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Exploring does not always have to be a solitary activity: bring friends to explore with or introduce you to new locations.</li>
            <li>Join registered student organizations, such as Nightwalking Club, to explore with other students. Search for RSOs on <a href="https://umassamherst.campuslabs.com/engage/Organizations">UMass Campus Pulse</a>.</li>
