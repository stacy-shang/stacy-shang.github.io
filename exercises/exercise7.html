                <h2>German morphological inflections model</h2>
                <p>I worked with a group in my computational linguistics course to improve a model that generated predictions for German morphological inflections. The model was provided with a training set and given a development set containing lemmas (root forms) of German words to generate predictions for inflected forms. My group focused on improving the model's accuracy with handling separable prefixes in German.</p>

                <h2>N-gram model</h2>
                <p>I created a model that generated random nonce words based on probabilities of bigrams and trigrams within a given dictionary of English words. The model also calculated the probabilities of a given list of nonce words, as well as a rating of how English-like the list is based on its perplexity.</p>

                <h2>Essay on semantics in monkey calls</h2>
                <p>I wrote an essay exploring field studies conducted on the communication systems of various monkey species and the significance of their findings in regards to the existence of semantics in primates, as discussed in the book <i>What It all Means</i> by Philippe Schlenker.</p>

                <h2>Expository piece on approaches to studying African American Language (PDF)</h2>
                <p>I wrote a paper on four main approaches that sociolinguists take to researching AAL mentioned in Walt Wolfram’s paper “The Sociolinguistic Construction of African American Language.” Specifically, I discuss how these approaches may perpetuate "sociolinguist myths" about the variety and how researchers can combat this issue in future studies.</p>
